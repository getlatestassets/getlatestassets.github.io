# Get latest Assets

An API to always get the latest assets from a github release.

## Usage

```bash
curl -LO https://api.getlatestassets.com/github/:owner/:repo/:asset-name
```

## Roadmap

* Include latest assets from GitLab
* Include latest assets from BitBucket
* Include latest releases from Atlassian-Products… (That would be scratching my own itch…)
